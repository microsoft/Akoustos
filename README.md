# Akoustos - Automated Bioacoustics Analysis Platform


## Project Description

With the goal of building an automated bioacoustics analysis platform, we hope it will:
1. enable us to help broader audience in acoustics community working on problems that can be solved by similar methods;
2. help conservation organizations and ecology practitioners to process audio recordings by detecting species presence more efficiently and more consistently with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

The near-term plan is to focus on automated sound detection and species classification tasks, using either binary, multi-class, or multi-label multi-class models.
